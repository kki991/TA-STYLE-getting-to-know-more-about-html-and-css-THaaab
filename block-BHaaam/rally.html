<p>John Cooper knew the Mini’s potential after Roy Salvadori won an informal road race to the Italian Grand Prix, beating fellow star Reg Parnell in an Aston Martin DB4 with an early Mini Cooper prototype. It took a few years to realise that giant-killing ability on the world stage but Paddy Hopkirk’s famous win in the 1964 Monte Carlo Rally, and successive ones for Timo Mäkinen and Rauno Aaltonen in 1965 and ’67, sealed the Mini’s reputation on twisty, snow-covered Alpine passes. The fact you could by one that looked – and went – much like the rally versions from your local BMC dealership is as big a part of Mini legend as Michael Caine and The Italian Job.</p>

<p>On road and rally stage the Audi Quattro’s influence is undeniable, the combination of turbocharging and four-wheel-drive laying a basic template for rally cars that survives to the modern day. A pet project of Ferdinand Piëch – grandson of Ferdinand Porsche, creator of the 917 and Volkswagen overlord until his death in 2019 – rallying was the perfect way to demonstrate the value of Quattro four-wheel-drive to Audi’s customers. The Quattro perfectly embodied Audi’s Vorsprung Durch Technik mantra, the timing perfect as it straddled the transition into the legendary Group B era and proved decisively that technology was the route to world domination, as much in marketing as it was in motorsport.</p>
