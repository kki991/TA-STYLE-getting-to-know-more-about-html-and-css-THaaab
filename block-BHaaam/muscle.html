<p>The legendary 1965 Mustang Shelby GT350 was a serious high- performance machine. In fact, some buyers that very first year felt these cars were a little too hardcore, and at the same time Shelby was on a rampage to cut costs. So for 1966, Shelby replaced, deleted, or made optional some of the carâ€™s signature high performance features like the adjustable Koni shocks, the fiberglass hood, free-flowing (and loud) side exhaust outlets, and that fully locking Detroit Locker rear differential.</p>

<h2 id="srt">Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat Redeye</h2>
<img src="car-images/dodge-challenger.jpg" alt="dodge challenger" width="700px">
<p>This beast is the most powerful Challenger Dodge makes. The base 2020 model (pictured) will set you back about $70K to start. Dodge introduced the Challenger in 1969, with Hellcat being introduced much later in 2015.
The Redeye packs a powerful punch and can breeze through a quarter mile in 10.8 seconds. And when we say powerful, we mean powerful; the Redeye weighs in at a whopping 4,514 pounds, but is still able to haul ass, thanks to a 797 hp engine. The best part? You get the gorgeous look of a classic car with modern amenities and features we know and love.</p>
