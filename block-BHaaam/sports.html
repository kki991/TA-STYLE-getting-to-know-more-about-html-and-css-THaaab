<p>The 2021 Porsche 718 Cayman captures the same physical and emotional excitement of driving that supercars do. This coupe and its convertible sibling—the 718 Boxster, which we review separately—provide unrivaled driver engagement among sports cars. The Cayman's otherworldly chassis provides an open line of communication between the driver, the car, and the road. To create the 718, Porsche knits together strong brakes, an unflappable suspension, and a steering system rich with feedback. The result is so good that both 718 body styles made our 2021 10Best list. The brand's flawless automatic and manual transmissions and potent engines—particularly the melodic flat-six—complete the picture. While the 2021 Cayman costs more than its distinguished rivals, the Chevy Corvette and Toyota Supra, it's still the most focused and satisfying choice in the segment.</p>

<h2 id="mclaren">McLaren 765LT</h2>
<img src="car-images/mclaren-765lt-101-1583186188.jpg" alt="McLaren 765LT" width="700px">
<p>The 2021 McLaren 765LT is a track-focused exotic sports car that weighs less than 3000 pounds and basically bolts a nuclear reactor behind its passengers. The latter constitutes a 754-hp twin-turbo V-8 that roars like a lion in heat. The letters in its name stand for Longtail, which indicates this McLaren means serious business. It shares a hollow-eyed expression, lightweight construction, and eminently customizable properties with the McLaren 720S. While its interior can be stripped down for further weight reduction, it remains a driver's paradise thanks to fantastic outward visibility and only the most essential controls. The 2021 765LT isn't for the faint of heart, and it's even more expensive than its shorter sibling, but that money help make it move quicker and corner sharper.</p>
